# Password Generator

## Goal of the project
- The main goal of this project was to use what we learned with JavaScript and generate randomized passwords. I had to give the user an option a choice between adding certain characters into their password and I also had to give the users a choice to select the length of their password. More specifically, the users had a choice to add lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters into their password unless they chose not to include it. After receiving the input, I had to randomize the wanted characters and create a password that matches the chosen length as well.

## Main Skills Applied
